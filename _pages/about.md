Hey, I'm Avi! I'm currently taking a gap semester from my MSCS in Computer Science at New York University to particpate in the MATS 9.0 Research Fellowship, where I'm advised by Shi Feng and Jacob Pfau. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley where I double majored in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I'm broadly interested in security/robustness for deep learning models as well as improving OOD generalization. Right now, I'm particularly focused on red teaming, building defenses for deployed AI systems, and AI oversight/control.

# Research

My latest paper, Stronger Universal and Transfer Attacks by Suppressing Refusals, has been accepted to the NeurIPS 2024 SafeGenAI Workshop, as well as the NAACL 2025 main conference, where I delivered a [poster presentation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-long.302/)!

Recent projects include SSH anomaly detection using keystroke inter-arrival times, creating universal transfer attacks on black-box language models, and adversarial curriculum learning for bus-bunching mitigation. 

At NYU, I'm advised by Rico Angell and He He, working on jailbreak defenses and model interpretability. I'm also extremely fortunate for the opportunity during my undergraduate studies to be mentored by [Chawin Sitawarin](https://chawins.github.io/) and [Julien Piet](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~julien.piet/) at Berkeley as a part of [David Wagner's group](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/). See my research page for more information.

# Other

Last summer, I interned at Adobe as a Machine Learning Engineer. Previously, I've worked at [Millennium Management](https://www.mlp.com/) as a quantitative research intern for two summers, where I assisted with data pipeline development, created a ML-based anomaly detection tool for market data, and analyzed trading signals. I have also worked under Kalyan Veeramachaneni as a member of MIT's [Data to AI Lab](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/), where I built an open source tool to fit ML pipelines for daily anomaly detection on publicly available time-series datasets.

In my free time, I enjoy reading (political science and fantasy!), weightlifting, running, photography, and playing the piano. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect on anything!
