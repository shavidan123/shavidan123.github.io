Hey, I'm Avi! I'm currently a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I plan to apply for Ph.D programs for the Fall 2025 class. I'm broadly interested in both machine learning applications for computer security, and security/robustness of machine learning models themselves. Right now, I'm particularly focused on adversarial attacks on language models and the effects of training data poisoning on model robustness.

# Research

My recent projects include SSH anomaly detection using keystroke inter-arrival times, creating universal transfer attacks on black-box language models, and adversarial curriculum learning for bus-bunching mitigation. 

I'm extremely fortunate for the opportunity to conduct research with amazing mentors [Julien Piet](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~julien.piet/) and [Chawin Sitawarin](https://chawins.github.io/) at Berkeley as a part of [David Wagner's group](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/). See my research page for more information.

# Other

Previously, I've worked at [Millennium Management](https://www.mlp.com/) as a quantitative research intern for two summers, where I assisted with data pipeline development, created a ML-based anomaly detection tool for market data, and analyzed trading signals. I have also worked under Kalyan Veeramachaneni as a member of MIT's [Data to AI Lab](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/), where I built an open source tool to fit ML pipelines for daily anomaly detection on publicly available time-series datasets.

In my free time, I enjoy reading (sociology and fantasy!), weightlifting, and playing the piano.
