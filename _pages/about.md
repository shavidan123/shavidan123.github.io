Hi, I'm Avi! I'm currently a 3rd year undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I plan to apply for Ph.D programs for the Fall 2025 class. I'm broadly interested in both machine learning applications for computer security, and security/robustness of machine learning models themselves. Right now, I'm particularly focused on adversarial attacks on language models and the effects of data poisoning on model robustness.

My recent research projects include SSH anomaly detection using keystroke inter-arrival times, creating universal transfer attacks on black-box language models, and adversarial curriculum learning for bus-bunching mitigation. See my research page for more information.
