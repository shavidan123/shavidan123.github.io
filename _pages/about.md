Hey, I'm Avi! I'm currently a masters student at New York University, after recently graduating from UC Berkeley where I double majored in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I'm broadly interested in both machine learning applications for computer security, and security/robustness of machine learning models themselves. Right now, I'm particularly focused on adversarial attacks on language models, prompt injection defenses for vision-language models, and the effects of training data poisoning on model robustness.

# Research

My latest paper, Stronger Universal and Transfer Attacks by Suppressing Refusals, has been accepted to the NeurIPS 2024 SafeGenAI Workshop, as well as the NAACL 2025 main conference, where I delivered a [poster presentation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-long.302/)!

Recent projects include SSH anomaly detection using keystroke inter-arrival times, creating universal transfer attacks on black-box language models, and adversarial curriculum learning for bus-bunching mitigation. 

I'm extremely fortunate for the opportunity to conduct research with amazing mentors [Julien Piet](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~julien.piet/) and [Chawin Sitawarin](https://chawins.github.io/) at Berkeley as a part of [David Wagner's group](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/). See my research page for more information.

# Other

This summer, I'm interning at Adobe as a Machine Learning Engineer. Previously, I've worked at [Millennium Management](https://www.mlp.com/) as a quantitative research intern for two summers, where I assisted with data pipeline development, created a ML-based anomaly detection tool for market data, and analyzed trading signals. I have also worked under Kalyan Veeramachaneni as a member of MIT's [Data to AI Lab](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/), where I built an open source tool to fit ML pipelines for daily anomaly detection on publicly available time-series datasets.

In my free time, I enjoy reading (sociology and fantasy!), weightlifting, running, photography, and playing the piano. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect on anything!
